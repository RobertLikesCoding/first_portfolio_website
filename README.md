# My first portfolio website!

- Description

  This project is part of the Codecademy Fullstack Web Developer Course but it also is my first attempt creating a functioning website for presenting my previous projects.

- Content

  The website consists of HTML, CSS and some JS. I used JS too create a dark mode toggle button. (It's in the top right corner)
  This was also the first time I used custom CSS variables, which was very handy.

. Workflow

  After finishing the constent, structure and design of the site I started working on the responsiveness and accessability.I tried implementing as much meaningful HTML tags as I know and I changed my image file sizes to improve loading speed.

. Improvements

  There is probably some CSS refactoring that I could do, to use some basic classes for applying flex style and centering content.
